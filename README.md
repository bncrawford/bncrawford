- 👋 Hi, I’m @bncrawford
- 👀 I’m interested in working on my front-end development skills so I can build the tools that I wish existed to make my work in education easier and more accessible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner projects that keep my new skills fresh! I'm also interested in anything that pushes me to be creative, adaptible, and sharpens my ability to learn independently.
